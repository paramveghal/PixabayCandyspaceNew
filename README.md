Code written in Swift 4.0 Programmed in Xcode 10.1

How to use the app?

Build the project and run on any device
Once running, search for your image and hit search
Scroll up and down to view your requested images

My Approach?

1) Initially looking at the API documentation and playing around with the endpoint and analysing the JSON respone
2) Thinking about how I was going to write the networking logic - going ahead and writing it with relevent Data file
3) Working out how I was going to take that imageURL and parse it into a displayable image in a tableViewCell
4) Once I had images showing and working with search, working out how I was going to cache.

What would I like to have added if I had more time?

- Re-write logic to incorporate correct caching of image via networking request
- Write logic in a way where I could write unit-tests 
- Clean up UI/storyboard and use seperate XIB's for views to show reusability of UIComponents
